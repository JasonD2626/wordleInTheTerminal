# wordleInTheTerminal
Over the course of ~1 week, I recreated the internationally popular word game originally created by Josh Wardle in IntelliJ. This version can be played an unlimited amount of times in its entirety through the Java terminal and even features the original game's feature of coloring words that are right/wrong spot/not in the word. I hope you enjoy playing!

Thank you to @techtribeyt on gitHub for the .txt that has all of Wordle's possible guesses (wordmaster_guesses.txt). This project would not have been possible on this scale if it wasn't for your amazing contribution!
